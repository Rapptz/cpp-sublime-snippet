# C++ Snippets for Sublime Text

This package adds some useful snippets for Sublime Text for C++11. It matches the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.html):

```cpp
if (/* condition */) {
    /* code */
}
```

## Installation

### Package Control (recommended)

The easiest way to install the C++ Snippets is by using [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/). Installing it [is documented here](https://packagecontrol.io/installation).

- Open Package Control (or hit Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P)
- Type _install_ and hit enter
- Type _C++ Snippets_ and hit enter again

### Cloning the Repository

You can manually install the package by using Git.

- Navigate to Sublime’s Packages directory
- Run `git clone https://github.com/Rapptz/cpp-sublime-snippet.git`

To find out where the Packages directory is, you can go to _Preferences_ and _Browse packages…_. This will open the directory in your file explorer.

### Downloading the Archive

If you don’t have Package Control or Git, you can also download the package. However you really should be using Package Control, because the process is simpler.

- Open [https://github.com/Rapptz/cpp-sublime-snippet](https://github.com/Rapptz/cpp-sublime-snippet) in your browser
- On the right hand side there is a _Download ZIP_ button – click it
- Go to _Preferences_ and _Browse packages…_ which opens the Packages directory
- Extract the archive inside the Packages directory
