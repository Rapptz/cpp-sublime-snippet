Hello!

Thanks for installing this package. This package started out of some
frustration with the lack of decent C++ plugins in Sublime Text. I figured
the first step to improving that would make some basic snippets that can be
seen as verbose for people to write.

You’re welcome to recommend any snippets in the issue page of the repository
which can be found here: https://github.com/Rapptz/cpp-sublime-snippet/issues

You’re also welcome to fork the snippets page and send in a pull request with
your snippet. The only thing I ask is that you keep the style consistent with
the other snippets.

Documentation for the snippets can be found the reference, which can is
conveniently here:

https://github.com/Rapptz/cpp-sublime-snippet/blob/master/reference.md

If you’d like to view the reference.md file offline, you can find it under 
Tools > Packages > C++ Snippets > View Documentation (Offline).
It’s also available on the git repository in View Documentation (Online).

Thank you for using these snippets!
